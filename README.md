# CPU_Scheduling_and_Deadlock_Detection
This project is a simulation of an operating system CPU scheduling environment that integrates preemptive priority scheduling with Round Robin, aging to prevent starvation, and deadlock detection and recovery in a system with multiple resource types and multiple instances per resource.
